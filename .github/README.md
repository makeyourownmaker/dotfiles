# Dotfiles

Instructions for the dotfiles repository at <https://github.com/makeyourownmaker/dotfiles>.

## Introduction

The dotfiles in this repository are installed using a **bare Git repository**. 
This method does not use symlinks (like most other dotfile repositories).

After the installation, all the dotfiles will be physically present in your home folder, yet, 
you will still have them under full version control.

## Installation


- Clone the [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/makeyourownmaker/dotfiles) to a bare Git repository into `~/.dotfiles`
- Move your existing dotfiles to `~/.dotfiles.backup`
- Check out all the dotfiles (and dot-directories) to your home directory

If you don't need your old dotfiles anymore, you can safely delete the `~/.dotfiles.backup` directory.

## Usage

Now all the dotfiles from the repository are installed in your home directory. 
However, as mentioned, you still have them under full version control via the bare Git repository in `~/.dotfiles`.

To interact with the bare Git repository, you need the following alias:

~~~bash
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME'
~~~

Note: the [`.bash_aliases`](https://github.com/makeyourownmaker/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_aliases) file in the dotfiles repository 
already contains this alias, so you're good to go.

With the `dotfiles` alias, you can now manage the dotfiles via the bare Git repository, just as you would with the `git` command:

Edited your dotfiles? No problem, commit and push the changes:

~~~bash
dotfiles add ~/.vimrc
dotfiles commit -m "Edit .vimrc"
dotfiles push
~~~

Pushed changes to the remote repository from another machine? Easy, just pull down the new version:

~~~bash
dotfiles pull
~~~

Want to know what's going on? Sure:

~~~bash
dotfiles status
~~~
